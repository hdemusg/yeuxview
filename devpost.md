## Inspiration

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), vision impairment or blindness affects over 2.2 billion people. Many eye diseases go undetected until it is too late, and early detection is crucial to prevent vision loss. This inspired us to develop eye-spy-high.tech, a tool that could help in early detection of eye diseases.

## What it does

Our hackathon project, eye-spy-high.tech, aims to provide an easy and accessible way for people to detect eye diseases in their early stages. Our solution uses cutting-edge technology, including the Google Cloud Platform, to provide a seamless user experience.

Google Cloud Platform
We leveraged the power of the Google Cloud Platform to build and deploy our solution. The Google Cloud Platform provides us with scalable and reliable infrastructure, which is essential for our solution to reach a large audience.

Vertex AI and PyTorch for the Model
The heart of our solution is the machine learning model that we built using Vertex AI and PyTorch. Vertex AI is a powerful platform that allows us to train, deploy, and manage our machine learning models with ease. We used PyTorch, a popular deep learning framework, to build our model. Our model is a deep learning convolutional neural network (CNN) that is trained to classify eye images as healthy or diseased.

Streamlit for the Frontend
We used Streamlit to build the user-friendly frontend of our solution. Streamlit is a powerful and easy-to-use framework that allows us to build beautiful and interactive applications with minimal effort. The frontend of our solution allows users to upload an eye image, which is then processed by our machine learning model and the results are displayed to the user.

Twilio for SMS and Emails
We integrated Twilio into our solution to provide users with SMS and email notifications about their eye disease detection results. Twilio is a powerful communication platform that allows us to send SMS and email messages programmatically. This feature ensures that users receive their results in a timely and convenient manner.

Flask for the Backend
We used Flask to build the backend of our solution. Flask is a lightweight and flexible framework that allows us to build robust and scalable applications. The backend of our solution handles the processing of the uploaded images, making predictions using the machine learning model, and sending SMS and email notifications to the users.

In conclusion, our hackathon project, Eye Disease Detection with Machine Learning, is a comprehensive solution that leverages the latest technology to provide an easy and accessible way for people to detect eye diseases in their early stages.
