## Inspiration

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), over 2.2 billion people are affected by vision impairment or blindness, with over 80% of cases being preventable or treatable. Many eye diseases go undetected until it is too late, and early detection is crucial to prevent vision loss. This inspired us to develop a tool that could help in early detection of eye diseases.
